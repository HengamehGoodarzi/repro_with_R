# Covid and Weather

There is a recent [report](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.20131490v1) by researchers claims that wheather parameters predict the development of Covid-19 infections. Several other preprints report no connection on different levels. We will try to see what happens in Germany.  
Challenges are to work with unknown packages and bring two different datasets together.  


1. Install the libraries from the library script.
2. Check for a German city of your choice whether there is a correlation between Mean Temperature at each day and Covid infection increases 7/14 days later
3. Make nice Figures
4. Calculate an appropriate model
5. Automate the process for several cities 

You can some info on the packages and its use [here](https://blog.exploratory.io/riem-package-getting-world-weather-data-in-super-easy-way-78aa94ed45f5) and [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/covid19.analytics/vignettes/covid19.analytics.html)
