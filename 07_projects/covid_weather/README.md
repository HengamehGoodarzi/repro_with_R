# Covid and Weather

There is a recent [report](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.20131490v1) by researchers claims that wheather parameters predict the development of Covid-19 infections. Several other preprints report no connection on different levels. We will try to see what happens in Germany.  

1. Install the libraries from the library script.
2. Check for a German city of your choice whether there is a correlation between Mean Temperature at each day and Covid infection increases 7/14 days later
3. Make nice Figures
4. Calculate an appropriate model
5. Automate the process for several cities
