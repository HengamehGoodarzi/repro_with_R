Dataset: 
CSV export from Flowjo. 
One row for each mouse. 
Column 1 is the mouse number. 
Column2 is the condition /treatment.
Frequencies of four different cell populations as columns as measured by flow cytometry. 
Separator used: ","

Tasks:
1. Read the CSV to import the dataset in R studio. 
2. For each cell population (column) create a graph (see attachmed sample pic) plotting the individual data points plus the mean and the standard deviation. Write your code in a way that it would also work if there were more mice or more cell populations in the dataset. 
3. Plot a second version of the previous plot showing the mouse number next to each individual point. 
4. (optional) Compare the differences in each cell population among the different conditions and plot this in a table for each cell population.
