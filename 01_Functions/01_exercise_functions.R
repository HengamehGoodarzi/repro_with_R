# write a function to load and retrieve the mean and max of each file and plot a boxplot
# You will first have to read in the creates files within the function with read.csv()





# plot the first 10 datasets
# the following line will ensure that each plot has a 2 by 5 panel layout
par(mfrow = c(2, 5))
par(mar=c(.5,1.5,.5,.5))
for () {
  # use the first function here 
}


# now plot only extreme datasets
# where the mean is more than 1 away from 0
# give the number of the data set
# write a separate function for this
# again, don't forget to first read in the files with read.csv() command 





# the following line cancels the last figure
dev.off()
# let's hope it's not more than 16:)
par(mfrow = c(4, 4))

# IF plot margin are too small enlarge plot window in the lower right corner of the RStudio IDE
# identify all data files with the pattern="file*"
# and delete them
